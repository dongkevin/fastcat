          <p>I have always asked the question "Why?" I wanted to know why the sky was blue, why certain objects smelled the way they do, and how the world worked. Science provided me with the answers to these questions.  </p>
            <p> I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been influenced by many outstanding teachers throughout my education journey. My middle school science teacher sparked my interest in science, and my high school chemistry teacherâ€™s support and enthusiasm for science ultimately led me to choosing chemistry as a major in college. College gave me the opportunity to be mentored and work with with brilliant scientists that introduced me to new ideas, how to use knowledge to create solutions, and the responsibility of sharing what I have learned with the world. I take pride in my responsibility as an educator to not only teach my students about the wonders of science, but also treating each person in our classroom with respect, maintaining a positive attitude, perserverence, strength, and ultimately an eternal desire to never quit learning. </p>
            <p> Acknowledgements go out to my parents and family for their everlasting love and support, and friends for showing me the joys in life. </p>

My artistic interests include photography, graphic design, painting, guitar, and violin. Chess also fascinates me because the strategy involved in the game offers insight on both the minds of yourself and your opponent. I used to participate in spelling competitions throughout middle and high school because I loved discovering new words. One odd talent is that I can ride the unicycle. Currently, I am writing a science book series for toddlers dedicated to my niece.</p>
